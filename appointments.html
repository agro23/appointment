Appointments
Create a website for booking appointments with you. Users should be able to enter their name, 
a description of the appointment, the appointment date, and start/end times.

After they submit the form, tell them the booking was successful. You might try using a modal
to do this, or redirect to a different page that contains the text "Booking Successful"!
(Note that you won't be able to move data you got from your user from page to page just yet.)

    <div class="container">
      <h1>BOOK AN APPOINTMENT</h2>
      name
      description
      date
      start/end time
      SUBMIT
    </div>

    <div class="ourModal">
      <h2>MODAL</h2>
      <p>You have successfully booked an appointment with me!</p>
      <p>See you then!</p>
    </div>
